              <p>My name is Victoria St. Michael and I am a Digital Journalism student at the University of Ottawa. I graduated from Algonquin College's Journalism Program in 2017 and have enjoyed the opportunity to further refine my skills in University. When I'm not at school, I work at the <a href="http://apparel.ca"target="_blank">Canadian Apparel Federation</a> as their Communications Co-ordinator. I also do some freelancing for the <a href="http://blog.studentlifenetwork.com"target="_blank">Student Life Network Blog</a>. I graduated high school in 2012 and (after a brief disastrous stint at Carleton University) spent a tough few years wandering aimlessly through life, trying to figure out what on earth to do with myself. I was struggling with a lot of mental health issues and by the summer of 2015 I had started to worry that I would never find my passion. </p>
            <p>To this day, I tell people that my decision to become a journalist was equal parts fate and serendipity. I applied for Algonquin's Journalism program on a whim, out of an overwhelming desire to do something -- anything -- with my life that wasn't a dead-end retail job. I was feeling woefully unfullfilled and wanted desperately to move back out of my parents' house. As it turns out, it was the best decision I ever made. </p>
            <p>I decided on journalism because apparently "it's in my blood." My mother has worked in the media all her life, as has her mother. When I was a toddler, my mother and I lived in the small apartment above my mother's small town newspaper office so she could bring her work upstairs on production days and look after me at the same time. I still remember the big rollers they used to literally paste the pages together, the hours of cutting and pasting my mother and her coworkers sat through while they put the next day's paper together on our livingroom floor in the middle of the night.</p>
            <p> So, you could say I had that little voice in the back of my head as I scrolled through Algonquin's list of programs and ultimately decided to give J-School a shot. From there, I never looked back. Here we are three gruelling, stressful, amazing years later and I've never looked back. Despite ongoing struggles with my mental health, my second shot at the University thing has been an amazing and enriching experience. I've learned that finding your true calling in life does wonders for motivation.</p>
            <p>Although journalism has basically consumed my life at this point (I'm a Slytherin, what can I say?) I do enjoy other things as well. A select few other things. Sometimes. I live in Ottawa with my fiancé, Chad, and our five furbabies -- <a href="http://instagram.com/fozzie_heidi_squeaks"target="_blank">three cats</a> and two ferrets. I have an avid interest in global and humanitarian issues, politics and all things "geek." I'm completely and shamelessly obsessed with Harry Potter, my life's dream is to have a home library with books covering every inch of wall space (a dream Chad and I share, fortunately) and I'm a leo. I hope you've enjoyed this pointlessly long bio, because apparently this is how I like to spend my evenings. </p>
